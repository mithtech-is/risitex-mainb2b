/**
 * `erpnext_mapping` — operator-defined sync rule pairing one Medusa
 * entity with one Frappe doctype, with a field-by-field mapping and
 * direction toggles.
 *
 * Replaces the earlier hard-coded "customer.* → polemarch.medusa.
 * webhooks.receive" pipeline with a generic, configurable mapper.
 *
 * Identity:
 *   `name` is operator-facing label (e.g. "Customer → ERPNext Customer").
 *   `(medusa_entity, doctype)` is NOT unique — an operator might want
 *   two flows for the same pair with different filters (e.g.
 *   B2B vs B2C Customers landing in different Frappe customer groups).
 *
 * Direction:
 *   Three layers of direction control, applied left-to-right:
 *     1. `direction` on the row — overall toggle. "push" means Medusa
 *        events trigger writes to Frappe. "pull" means the pull cron
 *        reads from Frappe and writes to Medusa. "both" enables both.
 *     2. `events` JSON array — which Medusa event names cause a push.
 *        Empty/null = no push subscription (use for pull-only rows).
 *     3. Per-field `direction` inside `field_mappings` — fine-grained
 *        override. A field can be `pull`-only (read from Frappe but
 *        never overwritten by Medusa) even on a `both` mapping. This
 *        is how we model "Frappe owns canonical name" vs "Medusa owns
 *        canonical email" without forking the row into two.
 *
 * Identity correlation:
 *   `key_medusa_field` + `key_erpnext_field` are the dot-path / Frappe
 *   fieldname pair used to find the same record across systems. On
 *   push: the value extracted from the Medusa source becomes the
 *   `name` used in the Frappe upsert URL. On pull: the value read
 *   from the Frappe doc is matched against Medusa records by the
 *   sync engine.
 *
 * Field mappings JSON shape:
 *   [
 *     {
 *       medusa_path: "email",                     // dot-path
 *       erpnext_field: "email_id",                // Frappe fieldname
 *       direction: "both",                        // override (optional)
 *       transform: "lowercase",                   // optional
 *       default: null,                            // optional
 *       required: true                            // skip whole sync if missing
 *     },
 *     { medusa_path: "first_name", erpnext_field: "customer_name", ... }
 *   ]
 *
 * State:
 *   `last_pull_at` is the high-water-mark for the pull cron's
 *   incremental `modified > X` filter. NULL = next pull is a full scan.
 *
 *   `last_pull_error` / `last_push_error` are truncated to 1KB to give
 *   the admin UI a one-shot reason without bloating the row.
