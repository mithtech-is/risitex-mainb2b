/**
 * `erpnext_sync_event` — durable log of every Medusa-side event we tried
 * to forward to the ERPNext (Frappe) `polemarch` app.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * The previous fire-and-forget subscriber dropped events on the floor if
 * ERPNext was down or rate-limited. The Frappe-side hourly reconciler
 * (`polemarch.medusa.reconcile`) is the safety net for *missed* events,
 * but it can't tell us *which specific webhooks failed* and why. This
 * table makes the failure surface visible (admin UI: GET /admin/erpnext/
 * events) and gives us a knob to manually retry without waiting for the
 * next reconcile tick.
 *
 * Identity:
 *   `event_id` is Medusa's `event.id` — used to dedupe and to correlate
 *   with rows in Frappe's `Medusa Sync Log` (which records the same id
 *   on the receiving side). One row per Medusa event id.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   pending  → row created right before the HTTP POST
 *   success  → 2xx response within 15s
 *   failed   → non-2xx, network error, or timeout
 *   skipped  → ERPNEXT_URL / ERPNEXT_WEBHOOK_SECRET not configured at
 *              forward time (we don't even attempt the POST)
 *
 * `attempts` counts every retry (including the initial send). The admin
 * "retry" route increments it and resets the row to `pending` before
 * re-attempting.
