/**
 * POST /admin/erpnext/events/:event_id/retry
 *
 * Re-attempts a previously failed (or skipped) ERPNext forward. The
 * stored payload from the original attempt is reused — we do NOT
 * re-fetch the customer/order from Medusa. Rationale: the original
 * payload represents the entity state *at the moment the event fired*
 * (an order at "placed" time has different fields than the same order
 * after fulfillment), and replaying that exact snapshot is what the
 * Frappe-side webhook handler expects to see.
 *
 * Idempotency: the Frappe receiver dedupes on x-medusa-event-id, so a
 * retry that succeeds after the original eventually went through too
 * is a no-op (logged as `deduped: true` on the Frappe side).
