 * Customer-submitted "please add this company to the marketplace" request.
 *
 * Created from the Holdings page when a user types a company that doesn't
 * exist in our product catalog. Admin reviews; once they actually add the
 * company as a Medusa product (manually, in the Medusa admin), they hit
 * "Approve" on this row, which fires a `Notification` to the customer
 * ("CompanyName is now on Risitex — add it to your holdings").
 *
 * The request itself doesn't create the product — that's still a manual
 * admin step. This row is just the inbox + notification trigger.
