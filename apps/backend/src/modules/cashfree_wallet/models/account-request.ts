/**
 * DPDP Act 2023 data-subject requests.
 *
 * The DPDP Act gives customers ("Data Principals") the right to a
 * machine-readable copy of their personal data and the right to have
 * it erased. Both flows are gated behind ops review:
 *
 * - "export" — ops compiles a JSON bundle of every customer-owned row
 *   (KYC, bank, demat, wallet ledger, orders, watchlist,`r`n *   audit log) and emails the customer a download link.
 * - "delete" — ops verifies the customer has no live obligations
 *   (open orders, undisbursed wallet balance, pending KYC) and then
 *   either purges or tombstones the rows according to the retention
 *   schedule documented in `/privacy`.
 *
 * The 30-day SLA in `/privacy` is enforced by an ops dashboard query
 * that surfaces requests with `created_at` older than 23 days.
 *
 * Storefront sees a per-customer view via `GET /store/account/<kind>`
 * so the UI can show the in-progress state and prevent spam (one open
 * request per kind at a time — see DB unique partial index).
