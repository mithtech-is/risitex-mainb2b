/**
 * POST /admin/communication/whatsapp-templates/refresh-system
 *
 * Re-applies the in-source seed catalog to existing system rows
 * (`is_system = true`) and inserts any new system templates.
 *
 * Why this exists: the boot-time seed loader is INSERT ... ON CONFLICT
 * DO NOTHING so admins can edit a system template without their changes
 * being clobbered on restart. But when the brand surface widens (new
 * placeholders, new tagline) we want a one-click way to push the
 * canonical wording back into existing rows. This endpoint does that.
 *
 * Skips rows where `is_system = false` (admin-created templates) — the
 * response includes their slugs so the admin can review.
 *
 * Side-effect: every overwritten row's `polygin_status` is reset to
 * "draft" because the wording changed, which means Meta-side approval
 * is stale. The Brand tab's bulk-reset action follows the same logic.
 *
 * Also re-runs the WhatsApp event-map seed so newly added events
 * (bank.*, demat.*, etc.) get wired without a full restart.
